**Project Overview**

The objective of this project is to explore the Zomato dataset and provide insights through data visualizations. The key questions addressed include:

    Which locations have the most restaurants?
    What is the distribution of restaurant ratings?
    How does the cost for two people relate to the restaurant rating?
    What are the most popular cuisines and restaurant chains?

    Online Order vs Rating: Compares ratings between restaurants with and without online ordering options.
    Most Popular Cuisines: Identifies the most common cuisines served by restaurants.
    Top Restaurant Chains: Analyzes which restaurant chains have the most outlets.

**Technologies Used**

    Python: Main programming language.
    Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
    NumPy: For numerical computations.

**Installation**
        
    Step 1: Clone the repository
        git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/zomato-data-analysis.git
        cd zomato-data-analysis

    Step 2: Install the required Python libraries
